# Create, read, update and delete

### Step 1: read
- On the overview page, build an overview of everything in the collection (you will find some provided code that's helpful for this)

### Step 2: create
- Build a form that contains all the relevant fields
- Once the form is submitted, save this info as a new entry in the database
- In a real application, you'd validate all of the data. In this case it's optional: focus on the database parts first

### Step 3: update
- Make a new page edit.php
- When clicking on an edit link for an entry, the edit page is loaded for that specific item
- When the edit form is submitted, the relevant entry in the database is updated

### Step 4: delete
- Build a link to delete.php that will delete a specific product from the database
- Afterwards, it will redirect to the overview
